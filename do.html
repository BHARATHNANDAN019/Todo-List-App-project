            To-do lists focus on improving otherwise adequate articles: tasks in to-do lists are important,
            significant, but not urgent (example: "insert a history section", or "provide more examples in the
            introduction").

            The "to do" collaboration mechanism has the following advantages:

            the list of tasks is permanently visible in the talk page of the article, i.e. where most editors will
            see it.
            articles with To-dos are automatically listed in the list of articles with To dos, so that additional
            editors unaware of the article are also attracted to it. More specialized sub-categories can be defined
            for specific purposes (e.g. for a WikiProject).
            Feel free to discuss to-do lists in the talk page of articles, to add new tasks, or to work on pending
            tasks. We also encourage you to contribute to other articles by visiting the list of "articles with
            To-dos", at Category:Wikipedia pages with to-do lists.

            Please note that the to-do list is edited in a special to-do page which is separate from the talk page
            of the article. However, its content automatically appears at the top of the talk page. Therefore, you
            cannot edit the normal talk page to modify the to-do list, as you may have expected. This is further
            explained in the detailed procedures below.

            The Advantages of Using a To Do List
            One of the most important reasons you should use a to do list is that it will help you stay organised. When
            you write all your tasks in a list, they seem more manageable. When you’ve got a clear outline of the tasks
            you’ve got to do and those you’ve completed, it helps you stay focused. While freeing up space in your mind
            for other more creative tasks.

            When you complete a task, you can cross it off your list. This gives you a sense of progress and
            achievement, something you’ll lack if you’re always rushing from one task to the next. If you feel a sense
            of achievement, it spurs you on and motivates you to keep moving forward.

            But that’s not the only benefits of a to do list. Here are a few more:

            Improves your memory: A to do list acts as an external memory aid. It’s only possible to hold a few pieces
            of information at one time. Keep a to do list and you’ll be able to keep track of everything, rather than
            just a few of the tasks you need to do. Your to do list will also reinforce the information, which makes it
            less likely you’re going to forget something.

            Increases productivity: A to do list allows you to prioritize the tasks that are more important. This means
            you don’t waste time on tasks that don’t require your immediate attention. Your list will help you stay
            focused on the tasks that are the most important.

            Helps with motivation: To do lists are a great motivational tool because you can use them to clarify your
            goals. You can divide your long-term goal into smaller, more achievable short-term goals and as you tick
            each one off your list, your confidence will increase.
